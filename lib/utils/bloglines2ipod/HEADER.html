Sync your Bloglines unread items to iPod Notes directory using <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/">Bloglines Web Services</a>. It is tested with ActivePerl on Win32. I think it can run on Mac OSX with some fixes (patches are welcome). It requires <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebService-Bloglines/">WebService::Bloglines</a> Perl module.
