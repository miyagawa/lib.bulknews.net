DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::YahooMessenger is a POE component to connect Yahoo!
    Messener. This module ripoffs a lot of code from Net::YahooMessenger for
    protocol implementations.

    API is intentionally made similar to that of PoCo::IRC.

EVENTS
    TBD.

CAVEATS
    This is ALPHA SOFTWARE: There maybe some bugs. API might change.
