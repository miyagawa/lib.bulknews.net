NAME
    WebService::Google::Suggest - Google Suggest as an API

SYNOPSIS
      use WebService::Google::Suggest;

      my $suggest = WebService::Google::Suggest->new();
      my @suggestions = $suggest->complete("goog");
      for my $suggestion (@suggestions) {
          print "$suggestion->{query}: $suggestion->{results} results\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    WebService::Google::Suggest allows you to use Google Suggest as a Web
    Service API to retrieve completions to your search query or partial
    query. This module is based on Adam Stiles' hack
    (http://www.adamstiles.com/adam/2004/12/hacking_google_.html).

METHODS
    new
          $suggest = WebService::Google::Suggest->new();

        Creates new WebService::Google::Suggest object.

    complete
          @suggestions = $suggest->complete($query);

        Sends your $query to Google web server and fetches suggestions for
        the query. Suggestions are in a list of hashrefs, for example with
        query "Google":

          @suggestions = (
            { query => "google", results => 122000000 },
            { query => "google toolbar", results => 2620000 },
            ...
          );

        Note that "results" value does NOT contain commas and "results"
        text.

    ua
          $ua = $suggest->ua;

        Returns underlying LWP::UserAgent object. It allows you to change
        User-Agent (Windows IE by default), timeout seconds and various
        properties.
