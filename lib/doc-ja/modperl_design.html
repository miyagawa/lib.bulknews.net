<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>notes on the design and goals of mod_perl-2.0</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>In version 2.0 of mod_perl, the basic concept of 1.x still applies:</P>
<PRE>
 Provide complete access to the Apache C API via the Perl programming language.</PRE>
<P>Rather than ``porting'' mod_perl-1.x to Apache 2.0, mod_perl-2.0 is
being implemented as a complete re-write from scratch.</P>
<P>For a more detailed introduction and functionality overview, see
<EM>modperl_2.0</EM>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="interpreter management">Interpreter Management</A></H1>
<P>In order to support mod_perl in a multi-threaded environment,
mod_perl-2.0 will take advantage of Perl's <EM>ithreads</EM> feature, new to
Perl version 5.6.0.  This feature encapsulates the Perl runtime inside
a thread-safe <EM>PerlInterpreter</EM> structure.  Each thread which needs
to serve a mod_perl request will need its own <EM>PerlInterpreter</EM>
instance.</P>
<P>Rather than create a one-to-one mapping of <EM>PerlInterpreter</EM>
per-thread, a configurable pool of interpreters is managed by mod_perl.
This approach will cut down on memory usage simply by maintaining a
minimal number of intepreters.  It will also allow re-use of
allocations made within each interpreter by recycling those which have
already been used.  This was not possible in the 1.3.x model, where
each child has its own interpreter and no control over which child
Apache dispatches the request to.</P>
<P>The interpreter pool is only enabled if Perl is built with -Dusethreads
otherwise, mod_perl will behave just as 1.xx, using a single
interpreter, which is only useful when Apache is configured with the
prefork mpm.</P>
<P>When the server is started, a Perl interpreter is constructed, compiling 
any code specified in the configuration, just as 1.xx does.  This
interpreter is referred to as the ``parent'' interpreter.  Then, for 
the number of <EM>PerlInterpStart</EM> configured, a (thread-safe) clone of the
parent interpreter is made (via <CODE>perl_clone())</CODE> and added to the pool of
interpreters.  This clone copies any writeable data (e.g. the symbol
table) and shares the compiled syntax tree.  From my measurements of a 
startup.pl including a few random modules:</P>
<PRE>
 use CGI ();
 use POSIX ();
 use IO ();
 use SelfLoader ();
 use AutoLoader ();
 use B::Deparse ();
 use B::Terse ();
 use B ();
 use B::C ();</PRE>
<P>The parent adds 6M size to the process, each clone adds less than half 
that size, ~2.3M, thanks to the shared syntax tree.</P>
<P>NOTE: These measurements were made prior to finding memory leaks
related to <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> in 5.6.0 and the GvSHARED optimization.</P>
<P>At request time, If any Perl*Handlers are configured, an available
interpreter is selected from the pool.  As there is a <EM>conn_rec</EM> and
<EM>request_rec</EM> per thread, a pointer is saved in either the
conn_rec-&gt;pool or request_rec-&gt;pool, which will be used for the
lifetime of that request.  For handlers that are called when threads
are not running (PerlChild{Init,Exit}Handler), the parent interpreter
is used.  Several configuration directives control the interpreter
pool management:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PerlInterpStart">PerlInterpStart</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The number of intepreters to clone at startup time.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PerlInterpMax">PerlInterpMax</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If all running interpreters are in use, mod_perl will clone new
interpreters to handle the request, up until this number of
interpreters is reached. when Max is reached, mod_perl will block (via
<CODE>COND_WAIT())</CODE> until one becomes available (signaled via <CODE>COND_SIGNAL())</CODE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PerlInterpMinSpare">PerlInterpMinSpare</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The minimum number of available interpreters this parameter will clone
interpreters up to Max, before a request comes in.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PerlInterpMaxSpare">PerlInterpMaxSpare</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
mod_perl will throttle down the number of interpreters to this number
as those in use become available
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PerlInterpMaxRequests">PerlInterpMaxRequests</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The maximum number of requests an interpreter should serve, the
interpreter is destroyed when the number is reached and replaced with
a fresh one.
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="tipool">TIPool</A></H2>
<P>The interpreter pool is implemented in terms of a ``TIPool'' (Thread
Item Pool), a generic api which can be reused for other data such as
database connections.  A Perl interface will be provided for the
<EM>TIPool</EM> mechanism, which, for example, will make it possible to
share a pool of DBI connections.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="virtual hosts">Virtual Hosts</A></H2>
<P>The interpreter management has been implemented in a way such that
each VirtualHost can have its own parent Perl interpreter and/or MIP
(Mod_perl Interpreter Pool).
It is also possible to disable mod_perl for a given virtual host.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="further enhancements">Further Enhancements</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>
The interpreter pool management could be moved into it's own thread.
<P></P>
<LI>
A ``garbage collector'', which could also run in it's own thread,
examining the padlists of idle interpreters and deciding to release
and/or report large strings, array/hash sizes, etc., that Perl is
keeping around as an optimization.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="hook code and callbacks">Hook Code and Callbacks</A></H1>
<P>The code for hooking mod_perl in the various phases, including
Perl*Handler directives is generated by the ModPerl::Code module.
Access to all hooks will be provided by mod_perl in both the
traditional Perl*Handler configuration fashion and via dynamic
registration methods (the ap_hook_* functions).</P>
<P>When a mod_perl hook is called for a given phase, the glue code has an 
index into the array of handlers, so it knows to return DECLINED right 
away if no handlers are configured, without entering the Perl runtime
as 1.xx did.  The handlers are also now stored in an
apr_array_header_t, which is much lighter and faster than using a
Perl  AV, as 1.xx did.  And more importantly, keeps us out of the Perl
runtime until we're sure we need to be there.</P>
<P>Perl*Handlers are now ``compiled'', that is, the various forms of:</P>
<PRE>
 PerlHandler MyModule (defaults to MyModule::handler or MyModule-&gt;handler)
 PerlHandler MyModule-&gt;handler
 PerlHandler $MyObject-&gt;handler
 PerlHandler 'sub { print &quot;foo\n&quot; }'</PRE>
<P>are only parsed once, unlike 1.xx which parsed every time the handler
was used.  there will also be an option to parse the handlers at
startup time.  note: this feature is currently not enabled with
threads, as each clone needs its own copy of Perl structures.</P>
<P>A ``method handler'' is now specified using the `method' sub attribute,
e.g.</P>
<PRE>
 sub handler : method {};</PRE>
<P>instead of 1.xx's</P>
<PRE>
 sub handler ($$) {}</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="perl interface to the apache api and data structures">Perl interface to the Apache API and Data Structures</A></H1>
<P>In 1.x, the Perl interface back into the Apache API and data
structures was done piecemeal.  As functions and structure members
were found to be useful or new features were added to the Apache API,
the xs code was written for them here and there.</P>
<P>The goal for 2.0 is to generate the majority of xs code and provide
thin wrappers were needed to make the API more Perlish.  As part of
this goal, nearly the entire APR and Apache API, along with their
public data structures will covered from the get-go.  Certain
functions and structures which are considered ``private'' to Apache or
otherwise un-useful to Perl will not be glued.</P>
<P>The Apache header tree is parsed into Perl data structures which live
in the generated <EM>Apache::FunctionTable</EM> and
<EM>Apache::StructureTable</EM> modules.  For example, the following
function prototype:</P>
<PRE>
 AP_DECLARE(int) ap_meets_conditions(request_rec *r);</PRE>
<P>is parsed into the following Perl structure:</P>
<PRE>
  {
    'name' =&gt; 'ap_meets_conditions'
    'return_type' =&gt; 'int',
    'args' =&gt; [
      {
        'name' =&gt; 'r',
        'type' =&gt; 'request_rec *'
      }
    ],
  },</PRE>
<P>and the following structure:</P>
<PRE>
 typedef struct {
     uid_t uid;
     gid_t gid;
 } ap_unix_identity_t;</PRE>
<P>is parsed into:</P>
<PRE>
  {
    'type' =&gt; 'ap_unix_identity_t'
    'elts' =&gt; [
      {
        'name' =&gt; 'uid',
        'type' =&gt; 'uid_t'
      },
      {
        'name' =&gt; 'gid',
        'type' =&gt; 'gid_t'
      }
    ],
  }</PRE>
<P>Similar is done for the mod_perl source tree, building
<EM>ModPerl::FunctionTable</EM> and <EM>ModPerl::StructureTable</EM>.</P>
<P>Three files are used to drive these Perl structures into the generated
xs code:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lib%2FModPerl%2Ffunction%2Emap">lib/ModPerl/function.map</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies which functions are made available to Perl, along with which
modules and classes they reside in.  Many functions will map directly
to Perl, for example the following C code:
<PRE>
 static int handler (request_rec *r) {
     int rc = ap_meets_conditions(r);
     ...</PRE>
<P>maps to Perl like so:</P>
<PRE>
 sub handler {
     my $r = shift;
     my $rc = $r-&gt;meets_conditions;
 ...</PRE>
<P>The function map is also used to dispatch Apache/APR functions to thin
wrappers, rewrite arguments and rename functions which make the API
more Perlish where applicable.  For example, C code such as:</P>
<PRE>
 char uuid_buf[APR_UUID_FORMATTED_LENGTH+1];
 apr_uuid_t uuid;
 apr_uuid_get(&amp;uuid)
 apr_uuid_format(uuid_buf, &amp;uuid);
 printf(&quot;uuid=%s\n&quot;, uuid_buf);
</PRE>
<PRE>

is remapped to a more Perlish convention:</PRE>
<PRE>
 printf &quot;uuid=%s\n&quot;, APR::UUID-&gt;new-&gt;format;</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lib%2FModPerl%2Fstructure%2Emap">lib/ModPerl/structure.map</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Specifies which structures and members of each are made available to
Perl, along with which modules and classes they reside in.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lib%2FModPerl%2Ftype%2Emap">lib/ModPerl/type.map</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This file defines how Apache/APR types are mapped to Perl types and
vice-versa.  For example:
<PRE>
 apr_int32_t =&gt; SvIV
 apr_int64_t =&gt; SvNV
 server_rec  =&gt; SvRV (Perl object blessed into the Apache::Server class)</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="lvalue methods">Lvalue methods</A></H2>
<P>A new feature to Perl 5.6.0 is <EM>lvalue subroutines</EM>, where the
return value of a subroutine can be directly modified.  For example,
rather than the following code to modify the uri:</P>
<PRE>
 $r-&gt;uri($new_uri);</PRE>
<P>the same result can be accomplished with the following syntax:</P>
<PRE>
 $r-&gt;uri = $new_uri;</PRE>
<P>mod_perl-2.0 will support <EM>lvalue subroutines</EM> for all methods which
access Apache and APR data structures.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="filter hooks">Filter Hooks</A></H1>
<P>mod_perl will provide two interfaces to filtering, a direct mapping to
buckets and bucket brigades and a simpler, stream-oriented interface.</P>
<P>Example of the stream oriented interface:</P>
<PRE>
 #httpd.conf
 PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::ReverseFilter</PRE>
<PRE>
 #Apache/ReverseFilter.pm
 package Apache::ReverseFilter;</PRE>
<PRE>
 use strict;</PRE>
<PRE>
 sub handler {
     my $filter = shift;</PRE>
<PRE>
     while ($filter-&gt;read(my $buffer, 1024)) {
         $filter-&gt;write(scalar reverse $buffer);
     }</PRE>
<PRE>
     return Apache::OK;
 }</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="directive handlers">Directive Handlers</A></H1>
<P>mod_perl 1.x provides a mechanism for Perl modules to implement
first-class directive handlers, but requires an xs file to be
generated and compiled.  The 2.0 version will provide the same
functionality, but will not require the generated xs module.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="<perl> configuration sections">&lt;Perl&gt; Configuration Sections</A></H1>
<P>The ability to write configuration in Perl will carry over from 1.x,
but will likely be implemented much different internally.  The mapping
of a Perl symbol table should fit cleanly into the new
<EM>ap_directive_t</EM> API, unlike the hoop jumping required in 1.x.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="protocol module support">Protocol Module Support</A></H1>
<P>Protocol module support is provided out-of-the-box, as the hooks
and API are covered by the generated code blankets.  Any functionality
for assisting protocol modules should be folded back into Apache if
possible.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="mod_perl mpm">mod_perl MPM</A></H1>
<P>It will be possible to write an MPM (Multi-Processing Module) in Perl.
mod_perl will provide a mod_perl_mpm.c framework which fits into the
server/mpm standard convention.  The rest of the functionality needed
to write an MPM in Perl will be covered by the generated xs code
blanket.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="build system">Build System</A></H1>
<P>The biggest mess in 1.xx is mod_perl's Makefile.PL, the majority of
logic has been broken down and moved to the Apache::Build module.
The Makefile.PL will construct an Apache::Build object which will have 
all the info it needs to generate scripts and Makefiles that
apache-2.0 needs.  Regardless of what that scheme may be or change to, 
it will be easy to adapt to with build logic/variables/etc., divorced
from the actual Makefiles and configure scripts.  In fact, the new
build will stay as far away from the Apache build system as possible.
The module library (libmodperl.so or libmodperl.a) is built with as
little help from Apache as possible, using only the <STRONG>INCLUDEDIR</STRONG>
provided by <EM>apxs</EM>.</P>
<P>The new build system will also ``discover'' XS modules, rather than
hard-coding the XS module names.  This allows for switchabilty between
static and dynamic builds, no matter where the xs modules live in the
source tree.  This also allows for third-party xs modules to be
unpacked inside the mod_perl tree and built static without
modification the mod_perl Makefiles.</P>
<P>For platforms such as Win32, the build files will be generated
similar to how unix-flavor Makefiles are.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="test framework">Test Framework</A></H1>
<P>Similar to 1.x, mod_perl-2.0 will provide a 'make test' target to
exercise as many areas of the API and module features as possible.</P>
<P>The test framework in 1.x, like several other areas of mod_perl, was
cobbled together over the years.  The goal of 2.0 is to provide a
test framework that will be usable not only for mod_perl, but for
third-party Apache::* modules and Apache itself.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="cgi emulation">CGI Emulation</A></H1>
<P>As a side-effect of embedding Perl inside Apache and caching
compiled code, mod_perl has been popular as a CGI accelerator.  In
order to provide a CGI-like environment, mod_perl must manage areas of
the runtime which have a longer lifetime than when running under
mod_cgi.  For example, the <STRONG>%ENV</STRONG> environment variable table, <STRONG>END</STRONG>
blocks, <STRONG>@INC</STRONG> include paths, etc.</P>
<P>CGI emulation will be supported in 2.0, but done so in a way that it
is encapsulated in its own handler.  Rather that 1.x which uses the
same response handler, regardless if the module requires CGI emulation
or not.  With an <EM>ithreads</EM> enabled Perl, it will also be possible to
provide more robust namespace protection.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="apache::* library">Apache::* Library</A></H1>
<P>The majority of the standard Apache::* modules in 1.x will be
supported in 2.0.  Apache::Registry will likely be replaced with
something akin to the Apache::PerlRun/Apache::RegistryNG replacement
prototype that exists in 1.x.  The main goal being that the non-core
CGI emulation components of these modules are broken into small,
re-usable pieces to subclass Apache::Registry like behavior.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="perl enhancements">Perl Enhancements</A></H1>
<P>As Perl 5.8.0 is current in development and Perl 6.0 is a long ways
off, it is possible and reasonable to add enhancements to Perl which
will benefit mod_perl.  While these enhancements do not preclude the
design of mod_perl-2.0, they will make an impact should they be
implemented/accepted into the Perl development track.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gvshared">GvSHARED</A></H2>
<P>As mentioned, the <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> API will create a thread-safe
interpreter clone, which is a copy of all mutable data and a shared
syntax tree.  The copying includes subroutines, each of which take up
around 255 bytes, including the symbol table entry.  Multiply that
number times, say 1200, is around 300K, times 10 interpreter clones,
we have 3Mb, times 20 clones, 6Mb, and so on.  Pure perl subroutines
must be copied, as the structure includes the <STRONG>PADLIST</STRONG> of lexical
variables used within that subroutine.  However, for XSUBs, there is
no PADLIST, which means that in the general case, <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> will
copy the subroutine, but the structure will never be written to at
runtime.  Other common global variables, such as <STRONG>@EXPORT</STRONG> and
<STRONG>%EXPORT_OK</STRONG> are built at compile time and never modified during
runtime.</P>
<P>Clearly it would be a big win if XSUBs and such global variables were
not copied.  However, we do not want to introduce locking of these
structures for performance reasons.  Perl already supports the concept
of a read-only variable, a flag which is checked whenever a Perl variable
will be written to.  A patch has been submitted to the Perl
development track to support a feature known as <STRONG>GvSHARED</STRONG>.  This
mechanism allows XSUBs and global variables to be marked as shared, so
<CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> will not copy these structures, but rather point to them.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="shared svpvx">Shared SvPVX</A></H2>
<P>The string slot of a Perl scalar is known as the <STRONG>SvPVX</STRONG>.  As Perl
typically manages the string a variable points to, it must make a copy
of it.  However, it is often the case that these strings are never
written to.  It would be possible to implement copy-on-write strings
in the Perl core with little performance overhead.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="compile time method lookups">Compile time method lookups</A></H2>
<P>A known disadvantage to Perl method calls is that they are slower than
direct function calls.  It is possible to resolve method calls at
compile time, rather than runtime, making method calls just as fast as
subroutine calls.  However, there is certain information required for
method look ups that are only known at runtime.  To work around this,
compile time hints can be used, for example:</P>
<PRE>
 my Apache::Request $r = shift;</PRE>
<P>Tells the Perl compiler to expect an object in the <EM>Apache::Request</EM>
class to be assigned to <STRONG>$r</STRONG>.  A patch has already been submitted to
use this information so method calls can be resolved at compile time.
However, the implementation does not take into account sub-classing of
the typed object.  Since the mod_perl API consists mainly of methods,
it would be advantageous to re-visit the patch to find an acceptable
solution.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="memory management hooks">Memory management hooks</A></H2>
<P>Perl has its own memory management system, implemented in terms of
<EM>malloc</EM> and <EM>free</EM>.  As an optimization, Perl will hang onto
allocations made for variables, for example, the string slot of a
scalar variable.  If a variable is assigned, for example, a 5k chunk
of HTML, Perl will not release that memory unless the variable is
explicitly <EM>undef</EM>ed.  It would be possible to modify Perl in such a
way that the management of these strings are pluggable, and Perl could
be made to allocate from an APR memory pool.  Such a feature would
maintain the optimization Perl attempts (to avoid malloc/free), but
would greatly reduce the process size as pool resources are able to be
re-used elsewhere.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="opcode hooks">Opcode hooks</A></H2>
<P>Perl already has internal hooks for optimizing opcode trees (syntax
tree).  It would be quite possible for extensions to add their own
optimizations if these hooks were plugable, for example, optimizing
calls to <EM>print</EM>, so they directly call the Apache <EM>ap_rwrite</EM>
function, rather than proxy via a <EM>tied filehandle</EM>.</P>
<P>Another possible optimization would be ``inlined'' XSUB calls.  Perl has
a generic opcode for calling subroutines, one which does not know the
number of arguments coming into and being passed out of a subroutine.
As the majority of mod_perl API methods have known in/out argument
lists, it would be possible to implement a much faster version of the
Perl <EM>pp_entersub</EM> routine.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="solar variables">Solar variables</A></H2>
<P>Perl global variables inside threaded MPMs are only global to the
current interpreter clone in which they are running.  A useful feature
for mod_perl applications would be the concept of a <EM>solar</EM> variable,
which is global across all interpreters.  Such a feature would of
course require mutex locking, something we do not want to introduce
for normal Perl variables.  It might be possible to again piggy-back
the <STRONG>SvREADONLY</STRONG> flag, which if true, checking for another flag
<STRONG>SvSOLAR</STRONG> which implements the proper locking for concurrent access
to cross-interpreter globals.</P>
