    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The cross-site scripting attack is one of the most common, yet
      overlooked, security problems facing web developers today.  A web
      site is vulnerable if it displays user-submitted content without
      checking for malicious script tags.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, Perl and mod_perl provide us with easy solutions to
      this problem.  We highlight these built-in solutions and also a
      introduce a new mod_perl module: <i>Apache::TaintRequest</i>.
      This module helps you secure mod_perl applications by applying
      perl's powerful "tainting" rules to HTML output.
    </p>

    <h3>What is "Cross-Site Scripting"?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Lately the news has been full of reports on web site security lapses.
      Some recent headlines include the following grim items:

      <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-7764433.html">
	Security problems open Microsoft's Wallet</a>, 
      <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-4030388.html">
	Schwab financial site vulnerable to attack</a>, or
      <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2808729,00.html">
	New hack poses threat to popular Web services</a>.  In all
	these cases the root problem was caused by a <i>Cross-Site
	Scripting</i> attack.  Instead of targeting holes in your
	server's operating system or web server software, the attack
	works directly against the users of your site.  It does this
	by tricking a user into submitting web scripting code
	(JavaScript, Jscript, etc.) to a dynamic form on the targeted
	web site.  If the web site does not check for this scripting
	code it may pass it verbatim back to the user's browser where
	it can cause all kinds of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the following URL:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>http://www.example.com/search.pl?text=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If an attacker can get us to select a link like this,and the
      Web application does not validate input, then our browser will
      pop up an alert showing our current set of cookies.This
      particular example is harmless; an attacker can do much more
      damage, including stealing passwords, resetting your home
      page, or redirecting you to another Web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even worse, you might not even need to select the link for this to
      happen.  If the attacker can make your application display a 
      chunk of html, you're in trouble.  Both the <b>IMG</b> and
      <b>IFRAME</b> tags allow for a new URL to load when html is displayed.
      For example the following HTML chunk is sent by the 
      <a href="http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2001-14.html">BadTrans</a>
      Worm.  This worm uses the load-on-view feature provided by the IFRAME tag
      to infect systems running Outlook and Outlook Express.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
  --====_ABC1234567890DEF_====
  Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
           boundary="====_ABC0987654321DEF_===="

  --====_ABC0987654321DEF_====
  Content-Type: text/html;
           charset="iso-8859-1"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable


  &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=3Dcid:EA4DMGBP9p height=3D0 width=3D0&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
  --====_ABC0987654321DEF_====--

  --====_ABC1234567890DEF_====
  Content-Type: audio/x-wav;
           name="filename.ext.ext"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
  Content-ID: &lt;EA4DMGBP9p&gt;</code>
</pre>

    <p>
      This particular example results in executable code running on the
      target computer.   The attacker could just as easily insert HTML
      using the URL format described earlier, like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>
      &lt;iframe src="http://www.example.com/search.pl?text=&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;"&gt;</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The "cross-site" part of "cross-site scripting" comes into
      play when dealing with the web browser's internal restrictions
      on cookies.  The JavaScript interpreter built into modern web
      browsers only allows the originating site to access it's own
      private cookies.  By taking advantage of poorly coded scripts
      the attacker can bypass this restriction.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Any poorly coded script, written in Perl or otherwise, is a
      potential target.  The key to solving cross-site scripting
      attacks is to never, ever trust data that comes from the web
      browser.  Any input data should be considered guilty unless
      proven innocent.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    
    <p>
      There are a number of ways of solving this problem for Perl and
      mod_perl systems.  All are quite simple, and should be used
      everywhere there might be the potential for user submitted data
      to appear on the resulting web page.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Consider the following script <i>search.pl</i>.  It is a simple
      CGI script that takes a given parameter named 'text' and prints
      it on the screen.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use CGI;

        my $cgi = CGI->new();
        my $text = $cgi->param('text');

        print $cgi->header();
        print "You entered $text";
</code></pre>

    <p>
      This script is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks
      because it blindly prints out submitted form data.  To rid
      ourselves of this vulnerability we can either perform input
      validation, or insure that user-submitted data is always HTML
      escaped before displaying it.</p> 

    <p>We can add input validation to our script by inserting the
    following line of code before any output.  This code eliminates
    everything but letters, numbers, and spaces from the submitted
    input.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        $text =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]*/ /g;
</code></pre>

    <p>
      This type of input validation can be quite a chore.  Another
      solution involves escaping any HTML in the submitted data.  We
      can do this by using the HTML::Entities module bundled in the
      libwww-perl CPAN distribution.  The HTML::Entities module
      provides the function HTML::Entities::encode().  It encodes HTML
      characters as HTML entity references.  For example, the character
      <b>&lt;</b> is converted to <b>&amp;lt;</b>, <b>&quot;</b> is
      converted to <b>&amp;quot;</b>, and so on.  Here is a version of
      <i>search.pl</i> that uses this new feature.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use CGI;
        use HTML::Entities;

        my $cgi = CGI->new();
        my $text = $cgi->param('text');

        print $cgi->header();
        print "You entered ", HTML::Entities::encode($text);
</code></pre>


    <h3>Solutions for mod_perl</h3>

    <p>
      All of the previous solutions apply to the mod_perl programmer
      too.  An Apache::Registry script or mod_perl handler can use the
      same techniques to eliminate cross-site scripting holes. For
      higher performance you may want to consider switching calls from
      HTML::Entities::encode() to mod_perl's much faster
      Apache::Util::escape_html() function.  Here's an example of an
      Apache::Registry script equivilant to the preceding
      <I>search.pl</I> script.
    </p>
<pre><code>
        use Apache::Util;
        use Apache::Request;

        my $apr = Apache::Request->new(Apache->request);

        my $text = $apr->param('text');

        $r->content_type("text/html");
        $r->send_http_header;
        $r->print("You entered ", Apache::Util::html_encode($text));
</code></pre>

   <p>
      After a while you may find that typing
      Apache::Util::html_encode() over and over becomes quite tedious,
      especially if you use input validation in some places, but not
      others.  To simplify this situation consider using the
      Apache::TaintRequest module.  This module is available from CPAN
      or from the <a href="http://www.modperlcookbook.org/">mod_perl
      Developer's Cookbook</a> web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apache::TaintRequest automates the tedious process of HTML
      escaping data.  It overrides the print mechanism in the mod_perl
      Apache module.  The new <I>print</I> method tests each chunk of text
      for taintedness.  If it is tainted the module assumes the worst and
      html-escapes it before printing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Perl contains a set of built-in security checks know as <i>taint
      mode</i>.  These checks protect you by insuring that
      <i>tainted</i> data that comes from somewhere outside your
      program is not used directly or indirectly to alter files,
      processes, or directories. Apache::TaintRequest extends this
      list of <i>dangerous</i> operations to include printing HTML to
      a web client. To <i>untaint</i> your data just process it with a
      regular expression.  Tainting is the Perl web developer's most
      powerful defense against security problems.  Consult the
      <b>perlsec</b> man page and use it for every web application you
      write.
    <p>
      To activate Apache::TaintRequest simply add the following
      directive to your httpd.conf.
    </p>
    <pre>       PerlTaintCheck on    </pre>
    <p>
      This activates taint mode for the entire mod_perl server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing we need to do modify our script or handler to use
      Apache::TaintRequest instead of Apache::Request.  The preceding
      script might look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        use Apache::TaintRequest;

        my $apr = Apache::TaintRequest->new(Apache->request);

        my $text = $apr->param('text');

        $r->content_type("text/html");
        $r->send_http_header;

        $r->print("You entered ", $text);

        $text =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]//;
        $r->print("You entered ", $text);
</code></pre>

    <p>
      This script starts by storing the tainted form data 'text' in
      $text.  If we print this data we will find that it is
      automatically HTML escaped.  Next we do some input validation on
      the data.  The following print statement does not result in any
      HTML escaping of data.
    </p>

    <h3>Tainting + Apache::Request....  Apache::TaintRequest</h3>

    <p>
      The implementation code for Apache::TaintRequest is quite
      simple. It's a subclass of the Apache::Request module, which
      provides the form field and output handling.  We override the
      <i>print</i> method, because that is where we HTML escape the
      data.  We also override the <i>new</i> method -- this is where
      we use Apache's TIEHANDLE interface to insure that output to
      STDOUT is processed by our print() routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have output data we need to determine if it is tainted.
      This is where the <i>Taint</i> module (also available from CPAN)
      becomes useful.  We use it in the <i>print</i> method to
      determine if a printable string is tainted and needs to be HTML
      escaped.  If it is tainted we use the mod_perl function
      Apache::Util::html_escape() to escape the html.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
package Apache::TaintRequest;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Apache;
use Apache::Util qw(escape_html);
use Taint qw(tainted);

$Apache::TaintRequest::VERSION = '0.10';
@Apache::TaintRequest::ISA = qw(Apache);

sub new {
  my ($class, $r) = @_;

  $r ||= Apache->request;

  tie *STDOUT, $class, $r;

  return tied *STDOUT;
}


sub print {
  my ($self, @data) = @_;

  foreach my $value (@data) {
    # Dereference scalar references.
    $value = $$value if ref $value eq 'SCALAR';

    # Escape any HTML content if the data is tainted.
    $value = escape_html($value) if tainted($value);
  }

  $self->SUPER::print(@data);
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
      To finish off this module we just need the TIEHANDLE interface
      we specified in our <i>new()</i> method.  The following code
      implements a <i>TIEHANDLE</i> and <i>PRINT</i> method. 
    </p>



<pre><code>
sub TIEHANDLE {
  my ($class, $r) = @_;

  return bless { r => $r }, $class;
}

sub PRINT {
  shift->print(@_);
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
      The end result is that Tainted data is escaped, and untainted
      data is passed unaltererd to the web client.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
      Cross-site scripting is a serious problem.  The solutions, input
      validation and HTML escaping are simple but must be applied
      every single time.  An application with a single overlooked form
      field is just as insecure as one that does no checking whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      To insure that we always check our data Apache::TaintRequest was
      developed.  It builds upon Perl's powerful data tainting feature
      by automatically HTML escaping data that is not input validated
      when it is printed.
