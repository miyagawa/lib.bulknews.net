<P>
Nowadays millions of people surf the Internet. There are millions of
Terabytes of data lying around. To manipulate the data new smart techniques
and technologies were invented. One of the major inventions was the
relational database, which allows us to search and modify huge stores of
data very quickly. We use <STRONG>SQL</STRONG> (Structured Query Language) to access and manipulate the contents of these
databases.

<CENTER><H1><A NAME="Apache_DBI_Initiate_a_persist">Apache::DBI - Initiate a persistent database connection</A></H1></CENTER>
<P>
When people started to use the web, they found that they needed to write
web interfaces to their databases. CGI is the most widely used technology
for building such interfaces. The main limitation of a CGI script driving a
database is that its database connection is not persistent - on every
request the CGI script has to re-connect to the database, and when the
request is completed the connection is closed.

<P>
<CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> was written to remove this limitation. When you use it, you have a database
connection which persists for the process' entire life. So when your
mod_perl script needs to use a database,
<CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> provides a valid connection immediately and your script starts work right
away without having to initiate a database connection first.

<P>
This is possible only with CGI running under a mod_perl enabled server,
since in this model the child process does not quit when the request has
been served.

<P>
It's almost as straightforward as is it sounds; there are just a few things
to know about and we will cover them in this section.

<P>
The DBI module can make use of the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> module. When it loads, the DBI module tests if the environment variable
<CODE>$ENV{MOD_PERL}</CODE> is set, and if the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> module has already been loaded. If so, the DBI module will forward every
<CODE>connect()</CODE> request to the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> module. <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> uses the <CODE>ping()</CODE> method to look for a database handle from a
previous <CODE>connect()</CODE> request, and tests if this handle is still
valid. If these two conditions are fulfilled it just returns the database
handle.

<P>
If there is no appropriate database handle or if the <CODE>ping()</CODE>
method fails, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> establishes a new connection and stores the handle for later re-use. When
the script is run again by a child that is still connected, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> just checks the cache of open connections by matching the <EM>host</EM>, <EM>username</EM> and <EM>password</EM>
parameters against it. A matching connection is returned if available or a
new one is initiated and then returned.

<P>
There is no need to delete the <CODE>disconnect()</CODE> statements from
your code. They won't do anything because the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> module overloads the <CODE>disconnect()</CODE> method with an empty one.

<P>
You will want to use this module if you are opening several database
connections to the server. <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> will make them persistent per child, so if you have ten children and each
opens two different connections (with different <CODE>connect()</CODE>
arguments) you will have in total twenty opened and persistent connections.
After the initial <CODE>connect()</CODE> you will save the connection time
for every <CODE>connect()</CODE> request from your <CODE>DBI</CODE> module. This can be a huge benefit for a server with a high volume of
database traffic.

<P>
You must <STRONG>not</STRONG> use this module if you are opening a special connection for each of your
users. Each connection will stay persistent and in a short time the number
of connections will be so big that your machine will scream in agony and
die.

<P>
If you want to use <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> but you have both situations on one machine, at the time of writing the
only solution is to run two Apache/mod_perl servers, one which uses <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> and one which does not.

<P>
After installing this module, the configuration is simple - add the
following directive to <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>



<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  PerlModule Apache::DBI</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Note that it is important to load this module before any other
<CODE>Apache*DBI</CODE> module and before the <CODE>DBI</CODE> module itself!

<P>
You can skip preloading <CODE>DBI</CODE>, since <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> does that. But there is no harm in leaving it in, as long as it is loaded
after
<CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE>.

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="Preopening_DBI_connections">Preopening DBI connections</A></H2></CENTER>
<P>
If you want to make sure that a connection will already be opened when your
script is first executed after a server restart, then you should use the <CODE>connect_on_init()</CODE> method in the startup file to preload every connection you are going to
use. For example:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  Apache::DBI-&gt;connect_on_init
  (&quot;DBI:mysql:myDB::myserver&quot;,
   &quot;username&quot;,
   &quot;passwd&quot;,
   {
    PrintError =&gt; 1, # warn() on errors
    RaiseError =&gt; 0, # don't die on error
    AutoCommit =&gt; 1, # commit executes immediately
   }
  );</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
As noted above, use this method only if you want all of apache to be able
to connect to the database server as one user (or as a very few users),
i.e. if your <CODE>user(s)</CODE> can effectively share the connection. Do
<STRONG>not</STRONG> use this method if you want for example one unique connection per user.

<P>
Be warned though, that if you call <CODE>connect_on_init()</CODE> and your database is down, Apache children will be delayed at server
startup, trying to connect. They won't begin serving requests until either
they are connected, or the connection attempt fails. Depending on your DBD
driver, this can take several minutes!

If you are not sure if this module is working as advertised, you should
enable Debug mode in the startup script by:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  $Apache::DBI::DEBUG = 1;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Starting with <CODE>ApacheDBI-0.84</CODE>, setting <CODE>$Apache::DBI::DEBUG = 1</CODE>
will produce only minimal output. For a full trace you should set
<CODE>$Apache::DBI::DEBUG = 2</CODE>.

<P>
After setting the DEBUG level you will see entries in the <CODE>error_log</CODE>
both when <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> initializes a connection and when it returns one from its cache. Use the
following command to view the log in real time (your <CODE>error_log</CODE> might be located at a different path, it is set in the Apache configuration
files):

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="Database_Locking_Risks">Database Locking Risks</A></H2></CENTER>
<P>
Be very very careful when locking the database (<CODE>LOCK TABLE ...</CODE>) or singular rows if you use <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> or similar persistent connections. MySQL threads keep tables locked until
the thread ends (connection is closed) or the tables are unlocked. If your
session <CODE>die()'s</CODE> while tables are locked, they will stay neatly
locked as your connection won't be closed either.

<P>
See the section <A HREF="././debug.html#Handling_the_User_pressed_Stop_">Handling the 'User pressed Stop button' case</A> for more information on prevention.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="The_Morning_Bug">The Morning Bug</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>
The SQL server keeps a connection to the client open for a limited period
of time. In the early days of <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> developers were bitten by so called <EM>Morning bug</EM>, when every morning the first users to use the site received a <CODE>No Data Returned</CODE> message, but after that everything worked fine.

<P>
The error was caused by <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> returning a handle of the invalid connection (the server closed it because
of a timeout), and the script was dying on that error. The <CODE>ping()</CODE> method was introduced to solve this problem, but it didn't worked properly
till
<CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> version 0.82 was released. In that version and afterwards
<CODE>ping()</CODE> was called inside the <CODE>eval</CODE> block, which resolved the problem.

<P>
It's possible that some <CODE>DBD::</CODE> drivers don't have the <CODE>ping()</CODE> method implemented. The <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> manpage explains how to write one.

<P>
Another solution was found - to increase the timeout parameter when
starting the database server. Currently we startup <CODE>MySQL</CODE> server with a script <CODE>safe_mysql</CODE>, so we have modified it to use this option:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  nohup $ledir/mysqld [snipped other options] -O wait_timeout=172800</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
172800 seconds is equal to 48 hours. This change solves the problem, but
the <CODE>ping()</CODE> method works properly in <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> as well.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Opening_connections_with_differe">Opening connections with different parameters</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>
When it receives a connection request, before it decides to use an existing
cached connection, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> insists that the new connection be opened in exactly the same way as the
cached connection. If I have one script that sets <CODE>LongReadLen</CODE> and one that does not, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> will make two different connections. So instead of having a maximum of 40
open connections, I can end up with 80.

<P>
However, you are free to modify the handle immediately after you get it
from the cache. So always initiate connections using the same parameters
and set <CODE>LongReadLen</CODE> (or whatever) afterwards.

<P>
You must use <CODE>DBI::connect()</CODE> as in normal DBI usage to get your <CODE>$dbh</CODE> database handler.
Using the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> does not eliminate the need to write proper <CODE>DBI</CODE> code. As the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> man page states, you should program as if you are not using <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> at all. <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> will override the DBI methods where necessary and return your cached
connection. Any <CODE>disconnect()</CODE> call will be just ignored.

If so you are trying to open a database connection in the parent httpd
process. If you do, children will each get a copy of this handle, causing
clashes when the handle is used by two processes at the same time. Each
child must have its own, unique, connection handle.

<P>
To avoid this problem, <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> checks whether it is called during server startup. If so the module skips
the connection cache and returns immediately without a database handle.

<P>
You must use the <CODE>Apache::DBI-&gt;connect_on_init()</CODE> method in the startup file.

To log a trace of <CODE>DBI</CODE> statement execution, you must set the
<CODE>DBI_TRACE</CODE> environment variable. The <CODE>PerlSetEnv DBI_TRACE</CODE>
directive must appear before you load <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> and <CODE>DBI</CODE>.

<P>
For example if you use <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE>, modify your <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE> with:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Replace <CODE>3</CODE> with the TRACE level you want. The traces from each request will be
appended to <CODE>/tmp/dbitrace.log</CODE>. Note that the logs might interleave if requests are processed
concurrently.

<P>
Within your code you can control trace generation with the
<CODE>trace()</CODE> method:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">

    <P>
DBI trace information can be enabled for all handles using this DBI class
method. To enable trace information for a specific handle use the similar <CODE>$h-&gt;trace</CODE> method.

<P>
Using the handle trace option with a <CODE>$dbh</CODE> or <CODE>$sth</CODE> is handy for limiting the trace info to the specific bit of code that you
are interested in.

<P>
Since many mod_perl developers use mysql as their preferred SQL engine,
these notes explain the difference between <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE> and
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>. The two influence the speed and size of the processes.

<P>
The <CODE>DBD::mysql</CODE> (version 2.0217) documentation includes the following snippet:

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  mysql_use_result attribute: This forces the driver to use
  mysql_use_result rather than mysql_store_result. The former is
  faster and less memory consuming, but tends to block other
  processes. (That's why mysql_store_result is the default.)</pre>

    <P>
Think about it in client/server terms. When you ask the server to
spoon-feed you the data as you use it, the server process must buffer the
data, tie up that thread, and possibly keep any database locks open for a
long time. So if you read a row of data and ponder it for a while, the
tables you have locked are still locked, and the server is busy talking to
you every so often. That is <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>.

<P>
If you just suck down the whole dataset to the client, then the server is
free to go about its business serving other requests. This results in
parallelism since the server and client are doing work at the same time,
rather than blocking on each other doing frequent I/O. That is
<CODE>mysql_store_result()</CODE>.

<P>
As the mysql manual suggests: you should not use <CODE>mysql_use_result()</CODE>
if you are doing a lot of processing for each row on the client side. This
can tie up the server and prevent other threads from updating the tables.

Sometimes you end up running many databases on the same machine. These
might have very varying database needs (such as one db with sessions, very
frequently updated but tiny amounts of data, and another with large sets of
data that's hardly ever updated) you might be able to gain a lot by running
two differently configured databases on one server. One would benefit from
lots of caching, the other would probably reduce the efficiency of the
cache but would gain from fast disk access. Different usage profiles
require vastly different performance needs.

<P>
This is basically a similar idea to having <A HREF="././strategy.html#One_Plain_Apache_and_One_mod_per">two Apache servers</A>, each optimized for its specific requirements.

In this section you will find scripts, modules and code snippets to help
you get started using relational Databases with mod_perl scripts. Note that
I work with <CODE>mysql</CODE> ( <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</A> ), so the code
you find here will work out of box with mysql. If you use some other SQL
engine, it might work for you or it might need some changes. YMMV.

Having to write many queries in my CGI scripts, persuaded me to write a
stand alone module that saves me a lot of time in coding and debugging my
code. It also makes my scripts much smaller and easier to read. I will
present the module here, with examples following:

<P>
Notice the <CODE>DESTROY</CODE> block at the end of the module, which makes various cleanups and allows
this module to be used under mod_perl and
<CODE>mod_cgi</CODE> as well. Note that you will not get the benefit of persistent database
handles with mod_cgi.

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="My_DB_Module_s_Usage_Examples">My::DB Module's Usage Examples</A></H2></CENTER>
<P>
To use <CODE>My::DB</CODE> in your script, you first have to create a <CODE>My::DB</CODE>
object:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  use vars qw($db_obj);
  my $db_obj = new My::DB or croak &quot;Can't initialize My::DB object: $!\n&quot;;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Now you can use any of <CODE>My::DB</CODE>'s methods. Assume that we have a table called <EM>tracker</EM> where we store the names of the users and what they are doing at each and
every moment (think about an online community program).

<P>
I will start with a very simple query--I want to know where the users are
and produce statistics. <CODE>tracker</CODE> is the name of the table.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    # fetch the statistics of where users are
  my $r_ary = $db_obj-&gt;sql_get_matched_rows_ary_ref
    (&quot;tracker&quot;,
     [qw(where_user_are)],
    );
  
  my %stats = ();
  my $total = 0;
  foreach my $r_row (@$r_ary){
    $stats{$r_row-&gt;[0]}++;
    $total++;
  }</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Now let's count how many users we have (in table <CODE>users</CODE>):

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  my $count = $db_obj-&gt;sql_count_matched(&quot;users&quot;);</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Check whether a user exists:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  my $username = 'stas';
  my $exists = $db_obj-&gt;sql_count_matched
  (&quot;users&quot;,
   [username =&gt; [&quot;=&quot;,$username]]
  );</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Check whether a user is online, and get the time since she went online (<CODE>since</CODE> is a column in the <CODE>tracker</CODE> table, it tells us when a user went online):

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  my @row = ();
  $db_obj-&gt;sql_get_matched_row
  (\@row,
   &quot;tracker&quot;,
   ['UNIX_TIMESTAMP(since)'],
   [username =&gt; [&quot;=&quot;,$username]]
  );
  
  if (@row) {
    my $idle = int( (time() - $row[0]) / 60);
    return &quot;Current status: Is Online and idle for $idle minutes.&quot;;
  }</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
A complex query. I join two tables, and I want a reference to an array
which will store a slice of the matched query (<CODE>LIMIT $offset,$hits</CODE>) sorted by <CODE>username</CODE>. Each row in the array is to include the fields from the <CODE>users</CODE> table, but only those listed in <CODE>@verbose_cols</CODE>. Then we print it out.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  my $r_ary = $db_obj-&gt;sql_get_matched_rows_ary_ref
    (
     &quot;tracker STRAIGHT_JOIN users&quot;,
     [map {&quot;users.$_&quot;} @verbose_cols],
     [],
     [&quot;WHERE tracker.username=users.username&quot;,
      &quot;ORDER BY users.username&quot;,
      &quot;LIMIT $offset,$hits&quot;],
    );
  
  foreach my $r_row (@$r_ary){
    print ...
  }</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Another complex query. The user checks checkboxes to be queried by, selects
from lists and types in match strings, we process input and build the <CODE>@where</CODE> array. Then we want to get the number of matches and the matched rows as
well.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  my @search_keys = qw(choice1 choice2);
  my @where = ();
    # Process the checkboxes - we turn them into a regular expression
  foreach (@search_keys) {
    next unless defined $q-&gt;param($_) and $q-&gt;param($_);
    my $regexp = &quot;[&quot;.join(&quot;&quot;,$q-&gt;param($_)).&quot;]&quot;;
    push @where, ($_ =&gt; ['REGEXP',$regexp]);
  }
  
    # Add the items selected by the user from our lists
    # selected =&gt; exact match
  push @where,(country =&gt; ['=',$q-&gt;param('country')]) if $q-&gt;param('country');
  
    # Add the parameters typed by the user
  foreach (qw(city state)) {
    push @where,($_ =&gt; ['LIKE',$q-&gt;param($_)]) if $q-&gt;param($_);
  }
  
     # Count all that matched the query
  my $total_matched_users =  $db_obj-&gt;sql_count_matched
    (
     &quot;users&quot;,
     \@where,
    );
  
    # Now process the orderby
  my $orderby = $q-&gt;param('orderby') || 'username';
  
     # Do the query and fetch the data
  my $r_ary = $db_obj-&gt;sql_get_matched_rows_ary_ref
  (
   &quot;users&quot;,
   \@display_columns,
   \@where,
   [&quot;ORDER BY $orderby&quot;,
    &quot;LIMIT $offset,$hits&quot;],
  );</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>

    <P>
<CODE>sql_get_matched_rows_ary_ref</CODE> knows to handle both <CODE>OR</CODE>ed and
<CODE>AND</CODE>ed params. This example shows how to use <CODE>OR</CODE> on parameters:

<P>
This snippet is an implementation of a watchdog. Our users want to know
when their colleagues go online. They register the usernames of the people
they want to know about. We have to make two queries: one to get a list of
usernames, the second to find out whether any of these users is online. In
the second query we use the <CODE>OR</CODE> keyword.

<P>
