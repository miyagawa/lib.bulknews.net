<P>
You installed mod_perl on your box at home, and you fell in love with it.
So now you want to convert your CGI scripts (which currently are running on
your favorite ISPs machine) to run under mod_perl. Then you discover that
your ISP has never heard of mod_perl, or he refuses to install it for you.

<P><LI>
<P>
You are an old sailor in the ISP business, you have seen it all, you know
how many ISPs are out there and you know that the sales margins are too low
to keep you happy. You are looking for some new service almost no one else
provides, to attract more clients to become your users and hopefully to
have a bigger slice of the action than your competitors.

</UL>
<P>
If you are a user asking for a mod_perl service or an ISP considering to
provide this service, this section should make things clear for both of
you.

<P>
An ISP has three choices:

<OL>
<P><LI>
<P>
ISPs probably cannot let users run scripts under mod_perl on the main
server. There are many reasons for this:

<P>
Scripts might leak memory, due to sloppy programming. There will not be
enough memory to run as many servers as required, and clients will be not
satisfied with the service because it will be slower.

<P>
The question of file permissions is a very important issue: any user who is
allowed to write and run a CGI script can at least read (if not write) any
other files that belong to the same user and/or group the web server is
running as. Note that <A HREF="././install.html#Is_it_possible_to_run_mod_perl_e">it's impossible to run <CODE>suEXEC</CODE> and <CODE>cgiwrap</CODE> extensions under mod_perl</A>.

<P>
Another issue is the security of the database connections. If you use
<CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE>, by hacking the <CODE>Apache::DBI</CODE> code you can pick a connection from the pool of cached connections even if
it was opened by someone else and your scripts are running on the same web
server.

<P>
There are many more things to be aware of so at this time you have to say <EM>No</EM>.

<P>
Of course as an ISP you can run mod_perl internally, without allowing your
users to map their scripts so that they will run under mod_perl. If as a
part of your service you provide scripts such as guest books, counters etc.
which are not available for user modification, you can still can have these
scripts running very fast.

<P><LI>
<P>
But, hey why can't I let my users run their own servers, so I can wash my
hands of them and don't have to worry about how dirty and sloppy their code
is (assuming that the users are running their servers under their own
usernames, to prevent them from stealing code and data from each other).

<P>
This option is fine as long as you are not concerned about your new systems
resource requirements. If you have even very limited experience with
mod_perl, you know that mod_perl enabled Apache servers while freeing up
your CPU and allowing you to run scripts very much faster, have huge memory
demands (5-20 times that of plain Apache).

<P>
The size depends on the code length, the sloppiness of the programming,
possible memory leaks the code might have and all that multiplied by the
number of children each server spawns. A very simple example: a server,
serving an average number of scripts, demanding 10Mb of memory which spawns
10 children, already raises your memory requirements by 100Mb (the real
requirement is actually much smaller if your OS allows code sharing between
processes and programmers exploit these features in their code). Now
multiply the average required size by the number of server users you intend
to have and you will get the total memory requirement.

<P>
Since ISPs never say <EM>No</EM>, you'd better take the inverse approach - think of the largest memory size
you can afford then divide it by one user's requirements as I have shown in
this example, and you will know how many mod_perl users you can afford :)

<P>
But you cannot tell how much memory your users may use? Their requirements
from a single server can be very modest, but do you know how many servers
they will run? After all, they have full control of
<EM>httpd.conf</EM> - and it has to be this way, since this is essential for the user running
mod_perl.

<P>
All this rumbling about memory leads to a single question: is it possible
to prevent users from using more than X memory? Or another variation of the
question: assuming you have as much memory as you want, can you charge
users for their average memory usage?

<P>
If the answer to either of the above questions is <EM>Yes</EM>, you are all set and your clients will prize your name for letting them
run mod_perl! There are tools to restrict resource usage (see for example
the man pages for <CODE>ulimit(3)</CODE>, <CODE>getrlimit(2)</CODE>, <CODE>setrlimit(2)</CODE> and
<CODE>sysconf(3)</CODE>, the last three have the corresponding Perl modules:
<CODE>BSD::Resource</CODE> and <CODE>Apache::Resource</CODE>).

<P>
[ReaderMETA]: If you have experience with other resource limiting
techniques please share it with us. Thank you!

<P>
If you have chosen this option, you have to provide your client with:

<UL>
<P><LI>
<P>
Shutdown and startup scripts installed together with the rest of your
daemon startup scripts (e.g <EM>/etc/rc.d</EM> directory), so that when you reboot your machine the user's server will be
correctly shutdown and will be back online the moment your system starts
up. Also make sure to start each server under the username the server
belongs to, or you are going to be in big trouble!

<P><LI>
<P>
Proxy services (in forward or httpd accelerator mode) for the user's
virtual host. Since the user will have to run their server on an
unprivileged port (&gt;1024), you will have to forward all requests from
<CODE>user.given.virtual.hostname:80</CODE> (which is
<CODE>user.given.virtual.hostname</CODE> without the default port 80) to
<CODE>your.machine.ip:port_assigned_to_user</CODE> . You will also have to tell the users to code their scripts so that any
self referencing URLs are of the form <CODE>user.given.virtual.hostname</CODE>.

<P>
Letting the user run a mod_perl server immediately adds a requirement for
the user to be able to restart and configure their own server. Only root
can bind to port 80, this is why your users have to use port numbers
greater than 1024.

<P>
Another solution would be to use a setuid startup script, but think twice
before you go with it, since if users can modify the scripts they will get
a root access. For more information refer to the section ``<A HREF="././control.html#SUID_Start_up_Scripts">SUID Start-up Scripts</A>''.

<P><LI>
<P>
Another problem you will have to solve is how to assign ports between
users. Since users can pick any port above 1024 to run their server, you
will have to lay down some rules here so that multiple servers do not
conflict.

<P>
A simple example will demonstrate the importance of this problem: I am a
malicious user or I am just a rival of some fellow who runs his server on
your ISP. All I need to do is to find out what port my rival's server is
listening to (e.g. using <CODE>netstat(8)</CODE>) and configure my own server to listen on the same port. Although I am
unable to bind to this port, imagine what will happen when you reboot your
system and my startup script happens to be run before my rivals! I get the
port first, now all requests will be redirected to my server. I'll leave to
your imagination what nasty things might happen then.

<P>
Of course the ugly things will quickly be revealed, but not before the
damage has been done.

</UL>
<P>
Basically you can preassign each user a port, without them having to worry
about finding a free one, as well as enforce <CODE>MaxClients</CODE> and similar values by implementing the following scenario:

<P>
For each user have two configuration files, the main file,
<EM>httpd.conf</EM> (non-writable by user) and the user's file,
<EM>username.httpd.conf</EM> where they can specify their own configuration parameters and override the
ones defined in <EM>httpd.conf</EM>. Here is what the main configuration file looks like:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  httpd.conf
  ----------
  # Global/default settings, the user may override some of these
  ...
  ...
  # Included so that user can set his own configuration
  Include username.httpd.conf</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  # User-specific settings which will override any potentially 
  # dangerous configuration directives in username.httpd.conf
  ...
  ...</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  username.httpd.conf
  -------------------
  # Settings that your user would like to add/override,
  # like &lt;Location&gt; and PerlModule directives, etc.</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Apache reads the global/default settings first. Then it reads the
<EM>Include</EM>'d <EM>username.httpd.conf</EM> file with whatever settings the user has chosen, and finally it reads the
user-specific settings that we don't want the user to override, such as the
port number. Even if the user changes the port number in his <EM>username.httpd.conf</EM> file, Apache reads our settings last, so they take precedence. Note that
you can use <A HREF="././config.html#Apache_Configuration_in_Perl">Perl sections</A> to make the configuration much easier.

<P><LI>
<P>
A much better, but costly solution is <EM>co-location</EM>. Let the user hook his (or your) stand-alone machine into your network,
and forget about this user. Of course either the user or you will have to
undertake all the system administration chores and it will cost your client
more money.

<P>
Who are the people who seek mod_perl support? They are people who run
serious projects/businesses. Money is not usually an obstacle. They can
afford a stand alone box, thus achieving their goal of autonomy whilst
keeping their ISP happy.

<P>
As we have just seen one of the obstacles of using mod_perl in ISP
environments, is the problem of isolating customers using the same machine
from each other. A number of virtual servers (don't confuse with virtual
hosts) technologies (both commercial and Open Source) exist today. Here are
some of them:

<UL>
<P><LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_The">The User-mode Linux Kernel</A></STRONG>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</A>


<P>
User-Mode Linux is a safe, secure way of running Linux versions and Linux
processes. Run buggy software, experiment with new Linux kernels or
distributions, and poke around in the internals of Linux, all without
risking your main Linux setup.

<P>
User-Mode Linux gives you a virtual machine that may have more hardware and
software virtual resources than your actual, physical computer. Disk
storage for the virtual machine is entirely contained inside a single file
on your physical machine. You can assign your virtual machine only the
hardware access you want it to have. With properly limited access, nothing
you do on the virtual machine can change or damage your real computer, or
its software.

<P>
So if you want to completely protect one user from another and yourself
from your users this might be yet another alternative to the solutions
suggested at the beginning of this chapter.

<P><LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_VMWare">VMWare Technology</A></STRONG>
<P>
Allows running a few instances of the same or different OSs on the same
machine. This technology comes in two flavors:

<P>
open source: <A
HREF="http://www.freemware.org/">http://www.freemware.org/</A> also known
as plex86

<P>
commercial: <A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">http://www.vmware.com/</A>

<P>
So you may want to run a separate OS for each of your clients

<P><LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_freeVSD">freeVSD Technology</A></STRONG>
<P>
freeVSD (http://www.freevsd.org), an open source project sponsored by Idaya
Ltd. The software enables ISPs to securely partition their physical servers
into many <EM>virtual servers</EM>, each capable of running popular hosting applications such as Apache,
Sendmail and MySQL.

<P><LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_S">S/390 IBM server</A></STRONG>
<P>
Quoting from: <A
HREF="http://www.s390.ibm.com/linux/vif/">http://www.s390.ibm.com/linux/vif/</A>


<P>
``The S/390 Virtual Image Facility enables you to run tens to hundreds of
Linux server images on a single S/390 server. It is ideally suited for
those who want to move Linux and/or UNIX workloads deployed on multiple
servers onto a single S/390 server, while maintaining the same number of
distinct server images. This provides centralized management and operation
of the multiple image environment, reducing complexity, easing
administration and lowering costs.''

<P>
In two words, this a great solution to huge ISPs, as it allows you to run
hundreds of mod_perl servers while having only one box to maintain. The
drawback is the price :)
