<P>
The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of the
Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server. With mod_perl it is
possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl, letting you easily do
things that are more difficult or impossible in regular CGI programs, such
as running sub requests. In addition, the persistent Perl interpreter
embedded in the server saves the overhead of starting an external
interpreter, i.e. the penalty of Perl start-up time. And not the least
important feature is code caching, where modules and scripts are loaded and
compiled only once, and for the rest of the server's life they are served
from the cache. Thus the server spends its time only running already loaded
and compiled code, which is very fast.

<P>
The primary advantages of mod_perl are power and speed. You have full
access to the inner workings of the web server and can intervene at any
stage of request-processing. This allows for customized processing of (to
name just a few of the phases) URI-&gt;filename translation,
authentication, response generation, and logging. There is very little
run-time overhead. In particular, it is not necessary to start a separate
process, as is often done with web-server extensions. The most wide-spread
such extension, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), can be replaced
entirely with Perl code that handles the response generation phase of
request processing. mod_perl includes two general purpose modules for this
purpose: <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE>, which can transparently run existing perl CGI scripts and <CODE>Apache::PerlRun</CODE>, which does a similar job but allows you to run ``dirtier'' (to some
extent) scripts.

<P>
You can configure your httpd server and handlers in Perl (using
<CODE>PerlSetVar</CODE>, and &lt;Perl&gt; sections). You can even define your own configuration directives.

<P>
Many people ask ``How much of a performance improvement does mod_perl
give?'' Well, it all depends on what you are doing with mod_perl and
possibly who you ask. Developers report speed boosts from 200% to 2000%.
The best way to measure is to try it and see for yourself! (See <A
HREF="http://perl.apache.org/tidbits.html">http://perl.apache.org/tidbits.html</A>
and <A
HREF="http://perl.apache.org/stories/">http://perl.apache.org/stories/</A>
for the facts.)

<P>
When you run your CGI scripts by using a configuration like this:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/httpd/cgi-bin/</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
you run it under a mod_cgi handler, you never define it explicitly. Apache
does all the configuration work behind the scenes, when you use a
ScriptAlias.

<P>
By the way, don't confuse <CODE>ScriptAlias</CODE> with the <CODE>ExecCGI</CODE>
configuration option, which we enable so that the script will be executed
rather than returned as a plain text file. For example for mod_perl and <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> you would use a configuration like:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  &lt;Location /perl&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options ExecCGI
    PerlSendHeader On
  &lt;/Location&gt;</pre>
        </td>

<P>
From the viewpoint of the Perl API, <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> is simply another handler that's not conceptually different from any other
handler. <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> reads in the script file, compiles, executes it and stores into the cache.
Since the perl interpreter keeps running from child process' creation to
its death, any code compiled by the interpreter is kept in memory until the
child dies.

<P>
To prevent script name collisions, <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> creates a unique key for each cached script by prepending <CODE>Apache::ROOT::</CODE> to the mangled path of the script's URI. This key is actually the package
name that the script resides in. So if you have requested a script <CODE>/perl/project/test.pl</CODE>, the scripts would be wrapped in code which starts with a package
declaration of:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  package Apache::ROOT::perl::project::test_e2pl;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> also stores the script's last modification time. Everytime the script
changes, the cached code is discarded and recompiled using the modified
source. However, it doesn't check the modification times of any of the perl
libraries the script might use.

<P>
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> overrides <CODE>CORE::exit()</CODE> with <CODE>Apache::exit()</CODE>, so CGI scripts that use <CODE>exit()</CODE> will run correctly. We will talk about all these details in depth later.

<P>
The last thing <CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> does, is emulation of mod_cgi's environment variables, like <CODE>$ENV{SERVER_NAME}</CODE>, <CODE>$ENV{REMOTE_USER}</CODE>
and so on. <STRONG>PerlSetupEnv Off</STRONG> disables this feature which saves some memory and CPU cycles.

<P>
From the viewpoint of the programmer, there is almost no difference between
running a script as a plain CGI script under mod_cgi and running it under
mod_perl. There is however a great speed improvement, but at the expense of
much heavier memory usage (there is no free lunch :).

<P>
When they run under mod_cgi, your CGI scripts are loaded each time they are
called and then they exit. Under mod_perl they are loaded once and cached.
This gives a big performance boost. But because the code is cached and
doesn't exit, it won't cleanup memory as it would under mod_cgi. This can
have unexpected effects.

<P>
Your scripts will be recompiled and reloaded by mod_perl when it detects
that you have changed them, but remember that any libraries that your
scripts might <CODE>require()</CODE> or <CODE>use()</CODE> will not be
recompiled when they are changed. You will have to take action yourself to
ensure that they are recompiled.

<P>
Of course the guide will answer all these issues in depth.

<P>
Let's see what happens to your script when it's being executed under
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE>. If we take the simplest code of (URI
<CODE>/perl/project/test.pl</CODE>)

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  print &quot;Content-type: text/html\n\n&quot;;
  print &quot;It works\n&quot;;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> will convert it into the following:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>  package Apache::ROOT::perl::project::test_e2pl;
  use Apache qw(exit);
  sub handler {
    print &quot;Content-type: text/html\n\n&quot;;
    print &quot;It works\n&quot;;
  }</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The first line provides a unique namespace for the code to use, and a
unique key by which the code can be referenced from the cache.

<P>
The second line imports <CODE>Apache::exit</CODE> which over-rides perl's built-in <CODE>exit</CODE>.

<P>
The <CODE>sub handler</CODE> subroutine is wrapped around your code. By default (i.e. if you do not
specify an alternative), when you use mod_perl and your code's URI is
called, mod_perl will seek to execute the URI's associated <CODE>handler</CODE> subroutine.

This document was written in an effort to help you start using Apache's
mod_perl extension as quickly and easily as possible. It includes
information about the installation and configuration of both Perl and the
Apache web server and delves deeply into the issues of writing and porting
existing Perl scripts to run under mod_perl. Note that it does not attempt
to enter the big world of using the Perl API or C API. You will find
pointers to coverage of these topics in the
<A HREF="././help.html#">Getting Help and Further Learning</A> section of this document. This guide tries to cover the most of the
<CODE>Apache::Registry</CODE> and <CODE>Apache::PerlRun</CODE> modules. Along with mod_perl related topics, there are many more issues
related to administering Apache servers, debugging scripts, using
databases, mod_perl related Perl, code snippets and more. The <A HREF="././start.html#">Guide's Overview</A> will help you to find your way through the guide.

<P>
It is assumed that you know at least the basics of building and installing
Perl and Apache. (If you do not, just read the INSTALL documents which are
part of the distribution of each package.) However, in this guide you will
find specific Perl and Apache installation and configuration notes, which
will help you successfully complete the mod_perl installation and get the
server running in a short time.

<P>
If after reading this guide and the other documents listed in
<A HREF="././help.html#">Getting Help and Further Learning</A> you feel that your questions remain unanswered, you could try asking the
apache/mod_perl mailing list to help you. But first try to browse the
mailing list archive (located at <A
HREF="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/modperl">http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/modperl</A>
). Often you will find the answer to your question by searching the mailing
list archive, since most questions have already been asked and answered
already! If you ignore this advice, do not be surprised if your question
goes unanswered - it bores people when they're asked to answer the same
question repeatedly - especially if the answer can be found in the archive
or in the documentation. This does not mean that you should avoid asking
questions, just do not abuse the available help and <STRONG>RTFM</STRONG> before you call for <STRONG>HELP</STRONG>. (You have certainly heard the infamous fable of the shepherd boy and the
wolves...) And if you do ask questions on the mailing list <EM>please</EM> make your subject line descriptive of the problem, not just ``Help'' -
you're far more likely to get replies if people can see the issue you are
talking about straight away.

<P>
If you find incorrect details or mistakes in my grammar, or you want to
contribute to this document please feel free to send me an email at <A

I want to thank all the people who donated their time and efforts to make
this amazing idea of mod_perl a reality. This includes Doug MacEachern, the
author of mod_perl, and all the developers who contributed bug patches,
modules and help. And of course the numerous unseen users around the world
who help to promote mod_perl and to make it a better tool.
